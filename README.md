# Machine Learning prediction models
Taking data as a csv file, I have built machine learning models to make predictions based on appropriate features. Predictions involve:
  - exploratory analysis and pre-processing of data
  - building a decision tree model for predictions
  - neural networks and building an ANN for this classification
