# Machine Learning prediction models

## 1. Predicting heart disease
Taking patient data as a csv file, I have built machine learning models to make predictions on whether or not a patient has heart disease based on appropriate features. Predictions involve:
  - exploratory analysis and pre-processing of data
  - building a decision tree model for predictions
  - neural networks and building an ANN for this classification
